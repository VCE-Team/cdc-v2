### <br>Problems

#### <br>Problem 1
 Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price 
being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) 
for a meal, find and print the meal’s total cost. Round the result to the nearest integer.

Sample Input
12.00

8

Sample Output
15

#### <br>Problem 2
Given set S = {1, 2, 3, . . . ,N}. Find two integers, A and B (where A < B), from set S such that 
the value of A&B is the maximum possible and also less than a given integer, K. In this 
case, & represents the bitwise AND operator.

Sample Input

0

#### <br>Problem 3
You will be given an integer n, and a threshold k. For each number i from 1 to n, find the 
maximum value of logical and , or and xor when compared against all integers through n 
that are greater than i. Consider a value only if the comparison returns a result less than k.

#### <br>Problem 4
  Complete the getGrade(score) function in the editor. It has one parameter: an integer, 
score, denoting the number of points Julia earned on an exam. It must return the letter 
corresponding to her grade according to the following:
If 25 < score ≤30, then grade A
If 20 < score ≤ 25, then grade B
If 15 < score ≤ 20, then grade C
If 10 < score ≤ 15, then grade D
If 5 < score ≤ 10, then grade E
If 0≤ score ≤5, then grade F.

#### <br>Problem 5
Ramesh went to a bookshop to buy books. There is a list of books with their value and price. 
Now Ramesh has limited money but he wants maximum value possible. Now there are 2 
kinds of books, one is denoted with 1, that is independent, another one is denoted as 2, 
which you have to buy in double, that means you can not buy a single or odd number of 
those books. Print the maximum value Ramesh can extract from the books.

Sample Input:
5 20
1 3 7 0
3 9 10 1
2 4 3 1
7 3 2 0
22 7 7 0

Sample Output:
20


#### <br>Problem 6
Given a string, S, of length N that is indexed from 0 to N-1, print its even indexed and oddindexed characters as two space-separated strings on a single line.

Sample Input
2
Hacker
Rank

Sample Output
Hce akr
Rn ak

#### <br>Problem 7
   There is an id code that is supposed to be given to all the aspirants of an exam. It is actually a 
substring of a given string. That means, the authority takes a string and then assigns all the 
unique substrings to all the students.

Sample Input: 
Abdc

Sample output: 
dc

#### <br>Problem 8
  Raman was playing a game, he starts with x coins. Now in every step, he wins and loses and 
he has to get the money or pay the money as needed. He came in contact with a psychic 
who can see the future and the Psychic predicted the outcomes after each step. Now Raman 
wants to start the game with the minimum wage where he doesn’t run out of money. Help 
Raman to find what money he should start with. The only rule to keep playing is not going in 
a credit situation.

Sample Input:

#### <br>Problem 9
   The user enters a string and a substring. You have to print the number of times that the 
substring occurs in the given string. String traversal will take place from left to right, not 
from right to left.

**Input Format**
The first line of input contains the original string. The next line contains the substring.

**Constraints**
1 <= len(string) <= 200
Each character in the string is an ascii character.

**Output Format**
Output the integer number indicating the total number of occurrences of the substring in 
the original string.

Sample Input 0
ABCDCDC
CDC

#### <br>Problem 10
 Repeating Characters
Problem Statement – Cod is given a string and he thinks the letters that are repeated do 
have more power. He gathers only the repeating characters and keeps them as the most 
powerful to least powerful manner. Now it is your turn to write a code that will help Codu to 
do that.
Note that: only lowercase alphabets are accepted in input.
**Input Format:**
A string in a single line

**Output Format:**
A string made of only the repeated characters as sorted their frequency reducin, if the same 
the lower ascii value comes before.

**Constraints:**
Length of string<=10^5

Sample Input:
Abcdefghaabca

Sample Output:
abc


#### <br>Problem 11
 Amit is a salesman who wishes to know the maximum revenue received from a given item of 
the N products each day . Amit has a sales record of N products for M days. Help Amit to find 
the highest revenue received each day.
Sample Testcases :
Input:
3 4
 101 123 234 344
143 282 499 493
283 493 202 304

#### <br>Problem 13
 Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, return a list of all 
unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target. You may 
return the combinations in any order. The same number may be chosen from candidates an 
unlimited number of times. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of 
the chosen numbers is different.

Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7

Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
These are the only two combinations.

Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8

Output: [[2,2,2,2],[2,3,3],[3,5]]

Input: candidates = [2], target = 1

Output: []

#### <br>Problem 14
You are given two sets, A and B. Your job is to find whether set A is a subset of set B. If 
set A is subset of set B, print True, else print False.
