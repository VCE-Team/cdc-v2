#### About Course
This course provides Problem Solving skills as required by companies for Campus Recruitment 
and also for other Competitive exams. The contents of this course include analyzing and solving the 
problem, basic methodology in programming, problem solving skills etc…

#### <br>Course Syllabus

#### <br>Sorting

##### <br>Problem 1
  Sort elements by their frequency and index:
Given an integer array, sort its element by their frequency and index. i.e., if two elements have 
different frequencies, then the one which has more frequency should come first; otherwise, the 
one which has less index should come first.

    Input: [3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8, 7, 8]
    
    Output:  [3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 6, 7]

##### <br>Problem 2
  Find the largest number possible from a set of given numbers where the numbers append to 
each other in any order to form the largest number

    Input:  { 10, 68, 75, 7, 21, 12 }

    Output:  77568211210

#### Searching

##### <br>Problem 1
  Given a sorted array ar[] and a target value, return the index of the first element in the array, 
which is greater than or equal to the target value, i.e., findthe ceil of the given target in ar[].

##### <br>Problem 2
 Given an array of sorted integers which represent box sizes and an integer representing an item
size, find best fit box for the item, say ar=[1,2,5,6,8,9,15, 18, 20]and size=7, we should return 8
as outcome.

#### Stack

##### <br>Problem 1
 Implement two stacks in a single array.

##### <br>Problem 2
 Design a data structure for peek(), push(), pop() and getMin() operations. Make sure that all the 
mentioned operations take only O(1) time to execute.

#### Queue

##### <br>Problem 1 
 Implement a queue using stack data structure 

##### <br>Problem 2
Design a Queue Data Structure ,which supports following operations enque, deque, and 
getMin() which takes O(1) time complexity.

#### Linked List

##### <br>Problem 1
 Reverse a singly linked list – Iterative and Recursive.

    Input:  6->20->3->14->5->NULL
    
    Output:  5->14->3->20->6->NULL

##### <br>Problem 2
Find the midpoint of a linked-list.

    Input:  1->2->3->4->5->NULL
    
    Output:  3
If there are even nodes, then there would be two middle nodes, we need to print the second 
middle element.

    Input:  1->2->3->4->5->6 ->NULL
    
    Output:  4
    
##### <br>Problem 3
 Reverse second half of singly linked list

    Input:  6->20->3->14->5->NULL
    
    Output:  6->20->3->5->14->NULL


#### Trees

##### <br>Problem 1
 Convert a Binary Tree into its Mirror Tree.<br>
Mirror of a Tree: Mirror of a Binary Tree T is another Binary Tree M(T) with left and right 
children of all non-leaf nodes interchanged.

##### <br>Problem 2
Print Left View of a Binary Tree<br>
Given a Binary Tree, print left view of it. Left view of a Binary Tree is set of nodes visible when 
tree is visited from left side.

#### Graphs

##### Problem 1
Topological sorting using dfs.

##### Problem 2
Detect a cycle in a directed graph/ undirected graph.
