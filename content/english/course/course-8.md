## About Course

This course provides a comprehensive exploration of object-oriented programming, exception 
handling, collections, and multi-threading through hands-on programming exercises. Students will 
gain practical experience by writing programs that incorporate these essential elements of modern 
software development. By the end of this practical course, students will have the necessary skills, 
practical experience in java Programming.

### Course Syllabus

### Problems

#### <br>Problem 1
Given an integer, perform the following conditional actions:
1. If is odd, print Weird
2. If is even and in the inclusive range of to , print Not Weird
3. If is even and in the inclusive range of to , print Weird
4. If is even and greater than , print Not Weird

#### <br>Problem 2   
For a given value N print no of multiples of 3,5 in the range [1,N]

#### <br>Problem 3
Kristen loves playing with and comparing numbers. She thinks that if she takes two different 
positive numbers, the one whose digits sum to a larger number is better than the other. If 
the sum of digits is equal for both numbers, then she thinks the smaller number is better. For 
example, Kristen thinks that 13 is better than31 and that12 is better than 11.
Given an integern, can you find the divisor of N that Kristin will consider to be the best?
input: 12
output :6
The set of divisors of 12 can be expressed as {1,2,3,4,6,12}The divisor whose digits sum to 
the largest number is (which, having only one digit, sums to itself). Thus, we print as our 
answer.

#### <br>Problem 4
print a hallow pyramid in following pattern.
* * * * * * * * * 
  *           * 
    *       * 
      *   * 
        *

#### <br>Problem 5 
Ramu started collecting different types of flowers for prayer, he wants to pick only one 
flower for each type, if plants are arranged in multiple straight lines and flower type 
represented by positive numbers how many maximum type flowers he can collect.

input:
4 5
1 1 1 2 1
1 2 2 1 3
1 1 7 1 1
5 1 4 2 3

OUTPUT: 6

#### <br>Problem 6
Given an array of characters chars, compress it using the following algorithm:
1. If the group's length is 1, append the character to s
2.Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length

input: aabbccc 

output: a2b2c3

#### <br>Problem 7
Raju gifted a bicycle to his son Ramu, enthusiastic Ramu fixed a engine to it and made it 
as a motor bike, but being afraid of his father, in father presence he using it as cycle, 
otherwise as a bike, there is only one key(i. e. object of Ramu class) , prepare Ramu, Raju 
classes, both should have whatIAm( ) method, When Ramu class method is invoked it 
should print im a bike, im a cycle.
(**Hint**: Inheritance, call parent class method using super
in child class)

#### <br>Problem 8
Create a class Sports which is having a method noOfPlayers(int n) for printing total 
players per team in that sport, Now create Soccer, VollyBall, Kabaddi classes which 
inherits Sports class and modifies the noOfPlayers(int n) method. call all the sports 
methods(use Over Riding/ Polymorphism ) 

#### <br>Problem 9
Create a class PrimeGenerator which has a method primes(int n) which prints all prime 
numbers in range of n.

#### <br>Problem 10
Write a Java program to create an abstract class Bird with abstract methods fly() and 
makeSound(). Create subclasses Eagle and Hawk that extend the Bird class and implement 
the respective methods to describe how each bird flies and makes a sound.

#### <br>Problem 11
You are given an interface AdvancedArithmetic which contains a method signature int 
divisor_sum(int n). You need to write a class called MyCalculator which implements the 
interface.divisor_Sum() function just takes an integer as input and return the sum of all its 
divisors. For example divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3 and 6, so divisor_sum should return 12.

#### <br>Problem 12
You are required to compute the power of a number by implementing a calculator. Create a 
class MyCalculator which consists of a single method long power(int, int). This method takes 
two integers, n and p as parameters and finds n power p. If either or is negative, then the 
method must throw an exception which says "n or p should not be negative". Also, if 
both and are zero, then the method must throw an exception which says "n or be should 
not be zero".

#### <br>Problem 13
Write a Java program that uses multithreading to print even and odd numbers alternatively. 
Create two threads: one to print even numbers along with their squres and another to print 
odd numbers along with cubes. The program should print the numbers from 1 to 20 in the 
following format:
Thread-Even: 2 4
Thread-Odd: 1 1
Thread-Even: 4 16
Thread-Odd: 3 27

#### <br>Problem 14
You are given pairs of strings. Two pairs (a, b) and(c, d) are identical if a=c and b=d . That 
also implies (a, b) is not same as (b, a) . After taking each pair as input, you need to print 
number of unique pairs you currently have(use HashSet).

input:
5
john tom
john mary
john tom
mary anna
mary anna

OUTPUT: 1 2 2 3 3

#### <br>Problem 15
Given a string of size ‘n’. The task is to remove or delete the minimum number of characters 
from the string so that the resultant string is a palindrome.

Input : aebcbda

Output : 2
Remove characters 'e' and 'd'
Resultant string will be 'abcba'which is a palindromic string

#### <br>Problem 16
Print row wise sum of a Matrix.
Example:
Input: array[4][4] = { {1, 1, 1, 1}, 
 {2, 2, 2, 2}, 
{3, 3, 3, 3}, 
{4, 4, 4, 4}};

Output: Sum of the 0 row is = 4
 Sum of the 1 row is = 8
 Sum of the 2 row is = 12
 Sum of the 3 row is = 16
