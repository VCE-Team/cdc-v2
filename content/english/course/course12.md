## <br> About Course

### <br>Course Syllabus

The 21st century skills include skills such as communication, collaboration, critical thinking, 
problem solving and digital literacy to name a few. Due to the universal nature of this attributes, they 
will stay relevant even in the coming centuries. With due regard to the same, I am putting forward my 
suggestion to rename my subject to ‘Life Skills Development’.

##### Topic 3 : Emotional Regulation 

###### Objective

 With the alarming rise of mental health issues and cases of suicide in the students of India, It

our capacity to educate the students on the importance of emotional regulation and how to mitigate the 
risks of being afflicted by mental health issues. This unit aims at spreading knowledge and awareness on 
emotional regulation and self help strategies one can use to develop emotional strength and resilience.
