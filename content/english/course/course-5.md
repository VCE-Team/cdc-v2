### Problems

#### 1. A positive integer is called a palindrome if its representation in the decimal system is the same when read from left to right and from right to left. For a given positive integer K of not more than 1000000 digits, write the value of the smallest palindrome larger than K to output. Numbers are always displayed without leading zeros.

**Input:**    
    The first line contains integer t,thenumber of test cases .Integers K are given in the next t lines.
    
**Output:**    
    For each K, output the smallest palindrome larger than K.
