### About Course
This course explores different strategies and data structures frequently employed to solve complex
computational challenges. Students will examine matrix operations and their practical applications
across various domains. The course investigates strategies for precomputing results to boost
algorithm performance and the sliding window technique for streamlined processing of sequential
data. Students will also cover hashing, searching, sorting, and two-pointer techniques. Students will
strengthen their understanding of these concepts and use them to solve real-world problems.
