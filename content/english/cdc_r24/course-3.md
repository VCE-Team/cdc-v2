## About Course

The Main Purpose of this course is to enhance Verbal ability skills that are vital for engineering
students with respect to their careers. Without proper Verbal skills, the application of one’s
ability in core subjects in the real world is limited. This course is designed with the aim of
narrowing the gap between the students’ core skills and their verbal skills and to equip them
for professional communication at the corporate level. In addition, this course also aims to
expose the students to the various topics of the verbal ability component of competitive exams
(like CAT, TOEFL, IELTS, Wipro, TCS, Infosys, and Cognizant) and train them in it. The students
improve their verbal ability from a general/theoretical as well as placements viewpoint.
