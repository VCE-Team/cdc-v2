### About Course
This course equips students with the essential building blocks of computer science: data structures
and algorithms. Topics include linear data structures such as stacks, queues, and linked lists, as well
as hierarchical structures like trees and graphs. Students will learn the operations and applications of
each data structure, along with the algorithms commonly used to manipulate them. The course
emphasizes the importance of choosing the right data structure for a given task and how to analyse
the efficiency of different algorithms. Through practical exercises and coding assignments, students
will gain hands-on experience in implementing and using them in real-world scenarios.
