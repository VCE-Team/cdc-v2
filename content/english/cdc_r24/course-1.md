### <br>About Course 

This course introduces students to the foundational concepts and techniques used in algorithmic
problem-solving, with a focus on understanding computational power and efficiency. Students will
gain hands-on experience with essential programming constructs and problem-solving strategies
through topics such as bit manipulation, loop structures for generating patterns, recursive
algorithms, and array manipulation. The course also covers techniques for analysing the frequency of
elements in data sets and string manipulation fundamentals. The course aims to develop students'
analytical and problem-solving skills applicable to real-world scenarios.<br>
