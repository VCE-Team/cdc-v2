### About Course
In this course students learn and practice advanced strategies for solving complex problems to
generate optimal solutions. Students will explore techniques like backtracking, greedy algorithms,
and dynamic programming, along with specialized data structures like tries and segment trees. They
will also explore game theory, learning how to analyse strategic decision-making. Through designing
solutions and exercises, students will gain practical experience in applying these strategies to solve
problems where optimization is necessary.
### Course Syllabus

### Greedy Method:
Introduction, general method.

### Dynamic Programming:
Introduction, Memoization and Tabular Methods to store the
results.

### Game Theory:
