## <br>About Course
Data and information visualization is the graphical communication of data and information for 
the purposes of presentation, confirmation, exploration, and analysis. Images can be used to 
convey numbers, concepts, and relationships using techniques such as maps, icons, graphs, and 
other visual forms. In the past decade, visualization has evolved into a discipline, drawing from 
such fields as computer graphics, human-computer interaction, perceptual psychology, and art. 
The emphasis of the course will be on exposing students to the current research issues and on 
identifying potential research topics in data visualization as it applies to large-scale big data 
systems.
Data visualization, which is sometimes called information visualization, is the representation of 
datasets through graphical means such as charts, maps, visual analytics interfaces such as 
dashboards, and interactive visualizations
