### About Course

Advanced Data Structures and algorithms is a course for an engineering graduate to improve 
the problem solving skills with the help of different Data Structures and algorithmic
approaches. These methods can be used in decision making and optimization problems.
Advanced Data Structures and algorithms course covers concepts to find strategies to win 
games, finding best paths and cost, searching and matching of words . The course also
includes fundamental terminology of non-linear data structures like Trees and Graphs which
are especially used to handle large amount of data. The course will also enable the use of
appropriate searching methods in handling collection of elements.

### Course Syllabus
## Mixed Bag Problems:
* Rotate an array of size n in clockwise direction k times.
* Prime Generator.
* Given a sorted array of n distinct integers where each integer is in the range from 0 
to m-1 and m > n. Find the smallest number that is missing from the array.
* Calculate the sum of the elements of matrix inside the rectangle defined by its upper left corner (row1, col1) and lower right corner (row2, col2).
* The birthday bar problem.
* Given a string text, you want to use the characters of text to form as many instances of the word “balloon” as possible.
* Partition the line of filing cabinets into K sections so as to minimize the maximum number of files a partition contains. E.g.: 10 20 30 40 50| 60 70 | 80 90 [N = 9, K = 3].
