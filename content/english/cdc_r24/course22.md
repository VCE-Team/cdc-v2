## <br>About Course
This course builds upon and extends the DevOps practice prevalent in software development to
build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models. The course stresses the importance of data, 
model, and code to successful ML deployments. It will demonstrate the use of tools, automation, 
processes, and teamwork in addressing the challenges associated with handoffs between data 
engineers, data scientists, software developers, and operations. The course will also discuss the use 
of tools and processes to monitor and take action
